## How to Use the Production-Readiness Checklist

### **Phase 1: Critical Path Resolution (Priority 1)**

**Goal:** Get the app running without crashes

```bash
# Run these commands first to identify blockers:
grep -r "@rneui" ./app                    # Must return empty
npx expo start --clear                    # Must start without errors
curl http://localhost:8081                # Must respond
```

**Critical Path Items to Fix First:**
1. âœ… Metro bundler starts cleanly
2. âœ… No "Unable to resolve module" errors  
3. âœ… QR code displays and app loads
4. âœ… All screens accessible without crashes
5. âœ… Zero @rneui imports in codebase

**Stop here if any critical path item fails. Nothing else matters until these pass.**

### **Phase 2: Core Functionality (Priority 2)**

**Goal:** Ensure all main features work end-to-end

**Test User Journeys:**
1. **New User Flow:** App launch â†’ onboarding â†’ first plant entry
2. **Daily Use Flow:** Home â†’ add journal entry â†’ set reminder â†’ view growth
3. **Care Flow:** Check watering guide â†’ mark as watered â†’ view treatment tips
4. **Data Flow:** Add measurement â†’ view growth chart â†’ export data

**Key Areas:**
- All hooks load data (mock data is fine)
- Forms accept input and save
- Navigation works between all screens
- Loading/error states display properly

---

### **Phase 3: Polish & UX (Priority 3)**

**Goal:** Professional user experience

**Focus Areas:**
- Consistent spacing and typography
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Accessibility compliance
- Dark/light mode consistency
- Error messaging and empty states

---

### **Phase 4: Pre-Production (Priority 4)**

**Goal:** Store submission readiness

**Final Steps:**
- Build testing on real devices
- Performance optimization
- App store assets preparation
- Legal compliance (privacy policy, terms)

---

## ðŸ“‹ **Daily QA Workflow**

### **For Developers (Daily)**
1. Run the verification commands before pushing code
2. Test on at least one real device
3. Check that new features don't break existing flows
4. Update checklist with any new items discovered

### **For QA/Product (Weekly)**
1. Go through the full checklist systematically
2. Test on multiple devices (iOS + Android)
3. Document any bugs found
4. Re-test fixed items to ensure they stay working

### **For Release (Before Submission)**
1. Complete 100% of critical path items
2. Complete 90%+ of all other checklist items
3. Get approval from product and technical leads
4. Tag release version in git

---

## ðŸ”§ **Common Issues & Solutions**

### **"Unable to resolve module" Errors**
```bash
# Clear all caches
npx expo start --clear
npm run clean
rm -rf node_modules && npm install

# Check import paths
find ./app -name "*.tsx" -exec grep -l "from.*\.\./" {} \;
```

### **@rneui Remnants**
```bash
# Find all @rneui imports
grep -r "@rneui" ./app

# Replace with native components (as we did)
# useTheme â†’ useColorScheme + custom theme
# Button â†’ TouchableOpacity + Text
# Card â†’ View with custom styling
```

### **Hook Errors**
```bash
# Verify all hooks exist
ls app/hooks/use*.ts

# Check hook exports
grep -r "export.*use" app/hooks/
```

## ðŸ“Š **Progress Tracking**

### **Completion Metrics**
- Critical Path: ___/5 (Must be 5/5)
- Core Features: ___/50 
- UI/UX: ___/20
- Testing: ___/15
- Build/Deploy: ___/10

**Overall:** ___/100 (Need 90+ for production)

### **Quality Gates**
- [ ] **Alpha Ready:** Critical path + core features working
- [ ] **Beta Ready:** Add UI/UX polish + device testing  
- [ ] **RC Ready:** Full checklist completion + performance
- [ ] **Production Ready:** All sign-off criteria met
