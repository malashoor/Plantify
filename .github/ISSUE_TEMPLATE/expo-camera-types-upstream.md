## Environment
- Expo SDK Version: 0.22.26
- expo-camera Version: 16.1.6
- TypeScript Version: 5.0.0
- Platform: iOS/Android

## Current Issues
The current type definitions for expo-camera have several limitations:

1. Camera component type is not properly recognized as a JSX element
2. Camera instance methods (takePictureAsync, etc.) are not properly typed
3. Static methods (requestCameraPermissionsAsync, etc.) are not properly typed
4. Camera props interface is incomplete

## Proposed Solution
We've created a comprehensive type definition file that addresses these issues. Here's the key improvements:

```typescript
declare module 'expo-camera' {
  export const CameraType: {
    front: 'front';
    back: 'back';
  };

  export interface CameraProps extends ViewProps {
    type?: 'front' | 'back';
    ratio?: string;
    flashMode?: FlashMode;
    autoFocus?: 'on' | 'off' | 'auto';
    whiteBalance?: 'auto' | 'sunny' | 'cloudy' | 'shadow' | 'incandescent' | 'fluorescent';
    zoom?: number;
  }

  export interface CameraInstance {
    takePictureAsync(options?: {
      quality?: number;
      base64?: boolean;
      exif?: boolean;
      skipProcessing?: boolean;
    }): Promise<{
      uri: string;
      width: number;
      height: number;
      base64?: string;
      exif?: any;
    }>;

    recordAsync(options?: {
      maxDuration?: number;
      maxFileSize?: number;
      quality?: number | string;
      mute?: boolean;
    }): Promise<{
      uri: string;
      durationMillis: number;
    }>;

    stopRecording(): Promise<void>;
  }

  export const Camera: ComponentType<CameraProps & { ref?: React.RefObject<CameraInstance> }> & {
    getCameraPermissionsAsync(): Promise<PermissionResponse>;
    requestCameraPermissionsAsync(): Promise<PermissionResponse>;
    getMicrophonePermissionsAsync(): Promise<PermissionResponse>;
    requestMicrophonePermissionsAsync(): Promise<PermissionResponse>;
  };
}
```

## Benefits
1. Proper typing for Camera component as a JSX element
2. Type-safe camera instance methods
3. Complete props interface
4. Proper typing for static methods
5. Better developer experience with autocomplete and type checking

## Implementation Notes
1. The type definitions are currently being used in our project at `types/expo-camera.d.ts`
2. We're temporarily using `any` for the camera ref while waiting for upstream fixes
3. The definitions have been tested with our plant identification feature

## Next Steps
1. Review and refine the proposed type definitions
2. Add tests to verify type correctness
3. Update documentation to reflect the new type system
4. Consider adding more specific types for camera features (e.g., barcode scanning)

## Additional Context
This improvement would help developers using TypeScript with expo-camera to have better type safety and developer experience. The current workaround of using `any` types is not ideal for production applications.
